# FactoryPal Assignment
This is an assignment for job application in [FactoryPal](https://factorypal.com/)


## What is it all about...
This is to display some charts based on the received data from backend (which is node.js here and work with graphQL). 

## React Native Chart Kits
Line Chart, Bezier Line Chart, Progress Ring, Bar chart, Pie chart, Contribution graph (heatmap) can be displayed by this package. There were some restrictions but due to lack of time, I did not spend a lot to investigate for the best possible solution. Using this package is just one of the many possible ways to display the data. 

## how to run
Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```
or 
```
yarn
```


Then should run the backend: 
```
npm run backend
```
or
```
yarn backend
```

and finally make the app with:
```
npm run android
```

### backend address
Please note that you have the change the backend address in the main index.js file. Current value is:
```
http://192.168.2.113:4000/graphql
```

# Android 
Please notice that currently this is only available on android as I don't have a mac device and also time was limited to find an online solution to handle the release of ios version. 

# UI/UX Design
There was no UI/UX design for this task and due to time limitation I did not spend time to design. Absolutely the colors, margins, paddings and a lot of other things must improve based on a design from an expert designer.
